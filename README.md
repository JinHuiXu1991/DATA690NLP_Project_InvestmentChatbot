# Introduction
A chatbot is a communication software application that can store appropriate answers to questions on a server, create models that continuously develop correct answers through conversations with customers, control exceptions, and provide accurate answers (Hwang, S.; Kim, J., 2021). Chatbot, an interactive AI (where the user influences the system and the system influences the user), has been widely deployed in finance, retail, public, and manufacturing industries. Appleʹs Siri, Amazonʹs Alexa, Googleʹs OKgoogle, and Samsung Electronicsʹ Bixby are good examples of voice conversion personal assistant services (Karnam, M.,2019). A Chatbot for investing purposes is an interface that communicates with financial services to give information and advice to users. Chatbots are dominating the financial industry as a method of customer interaction. Established financial organizations are experimenting with chatbots, mainly in the retail banking, investment management, and wealth management sectors. Financial institutions have embraced this trend and experts predict that, within five years, bots will replace conventional online interfaces such as websites or mobile apps (Dasagrandhi, C. S., 2022). 

Investment Chatbot creates a dedicated relationship serving the investors with their investment management. The chatbot will crunch the numbers and do all the heavy lifting so that investors can focus their efforts on their investment (Botbot.AI, 2018). This service for the investor’s investments is tailored to the needs at any time of the day without worrying more about opening hours or having to consult investment personnel and enduring long waiting times.

# Why are Chatbots a More Significant Presence in Today’s Financial Environment?

Users sometimes have to invest a lot of time on the Internet to find relevant information regarding the investments in mutual funds, bonds, cryptocurrency, stocks, and portfolio management. To alleviate these problems, our Investment Chatbot is an innovative idea built on Dialogflow to provide personalized assistance in discovering important information about any type of investment, as well as help invest, forecast stock prices, and recommend the best investment strategies based on current market stock prices. It can be challenging for investors to maintain track of every stock, especially the ones they just want to monitor. There are potential chances that sometimes investors could miss out on a buy or a sell. So, it is important to build an Investment Chatbot to ensure proper management of their investment portfolio. Eventually, any investor can take advantage of such a multifunctional investment system to grow their wealth.

# Features
The objective of this project is to develop an Investment Chatbot that can assist users to learn how to invest wisely and provide a convenient approach to gather the necessary information and make proper financial investment decisions. The chatbot is task-oriented, which focuses on the pre-defined investment tasks and responds to very specific investment commands. The Investment Chatbot consists of four main components:

* Investment Education
  
  One of the most essential features of the investment chatbot is to provide definitions and tutorials for different investment options to users since not everyone has the financial knowledge and experience to make investment decisions. This chatbot can help users to learn different types of investment and provide them with plenty of additional resources for further learning. Whether it is mutual funds, bonds, stocks, or cryptocurrency, the Investment Chatbot can provide all aspects of information to assist users to make the right financial moves and planning for the future.

* Information Retrieval

  The investment chatbot provides information retrieval services such as suggestions for investment tools and real-time stock price querying. Even though the users have never invested a dollar or are already experienced investors, they can take advantage of the information retrieval feature. First-time investors can retrieve information on useful investment tools and start their journey. On the other hand, the stock price checking feature provides traders and active investors with more accurate information reflecting the market such as High Price, Low Price, Open Price, and Close Price of the stocks. The chatbot will display all the necessary information to support their financial decisions in real-time.

* Stock Price Forecasting
  
  The investment chatbot also provides stock price prediction services for S&P500 stocks. Forecasting the stock market's opening moves can be a useful tool. Investors can query about the particular stock they are interested in and get the forecast value for the next five days before making their decision to buy or sell, especially for the swing traders. 


* Stock Recommendation

  On any particular day, when the users want a recommendation for any S&P500 stocks, the chatbot shortlists the stocks to trade based on technical indicators such as ‘Based on Relative Strength Index (RSI)’ and ‘Based on Volume.’ Technical indicators are tools that help analyze the movement in the stock prices and whether the ongoing trend is either going to continue or reverse. It helps the traders make buy or sell a particular stock of interest.
